Wi-Fi indoor positioning system for Manipal University Jaipur.

Works without Internet/GPS/Anything!

The problem of Wi-Fi based indoor localization of a device consists in determining the position of client devices with respect to access points. Many techniques exist to accomplish this, and these may be classified into three main types:

- Received signal strength indication (RSSI), fingerprinting
- Angle of arrival (AoA)
- Time of flight (ToF) based techniques.

We have chose the most common and widespread localization technique used for positioning with wireless access points, i.e. measuring the intensity of the received signal (Received signal strength indication or RSSI) and the method of "fingerprinting" via utilizing machine learning algorithm called [Random Forest]().
